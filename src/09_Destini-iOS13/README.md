#  Destini

## Our Goal

The goal of this challenge is to get you comfortable with implementing the MVC design pattern and thinking about the state of your app. In addition, you will be reviewing the concept of Swift Structures and using it to separate the Model from the Controller. 

## What you will create

In this app, you will be creating a “choose your own adventure” game similar to the App Store hit “Life Line” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience


## Story Strings
```
        Story(
            title: "Your car has blown a tire on a winding road in the middle of nowhere with no cell phone reception. You decide to hitchhike. A rusty pickup truck rumbles to a stop next to you. A man with a wide brimmed hat with soulless eyes opens the passenger door for you and asks: 'Need a ride, boy?'.",
            choice1: "I'll hop in. Thanks for the help!", choice1Destination: 2,
            choice2: "Better ask him if he's a murderer first.", choice2Destination: 1
        ),
        Story(
            title: "He nods slowly, unfazed by the question.",
            choice1: "At least he's honest. I'll climb in.", choice1Destination: 2,
            choice2: "Wait, I know how to change a tire.", choice2Destination: 3
        ),
        Story(
            title: "As you begin to drive, the stranger starts talking about his relationship with his mother. He gets angrier and angrier by the minute. He asks you to open the glovebox. Inside you find a bloody knife, two severed fingers, and a cassette tape of Elton John. He reaches for the glove box.",
            choice1: "I love Elton John! Hand him the cassette tape.", choice1Destination: 5,

        Story(
            title: "You bond with the murderer while crooning verses of 'Can you feel the love tonight'. He drops you off at the next town. Before you go he asks you if you know any good places to dump bodies. You reply: 'Try the pier.'",

            choice2: "End", choice2Destination: 0
        )
